# Group Project for IT and eGov Technologies

**University:** Tallinn University of Technology (TalTech)  
**Course:** ITE4120 Introduction to IT and eGov Technologies  
**Semester:** Autumn 2026

## About
A group project for the IT and eGov Technologies course: a library book catalogue and lending component (BOOKS), built on the course template.

## Team
- Mari Tarum-Seilenthal
- Heiki Ilisson
- Helena Toompalu

## Project requirements
- Database with two tables: `books.book` and `books.copy` (foreign key copy → book)
- APIs: list/search books, register a book, update lending, remove a book
- Borrower name fetched from the mock registry (X-Road style)
- Two forms: register form and lending form, with field validation as in the spec
- At least two business tests as passing automated tests
- Each team member commits their own part and keeps a work diary

## Work plan

- [ ] **0. Set up the app on each laptop.** Follow the setup steps.
  - *Check:* the Animals page opens at http://localhost:18640.
  - [ ] Helena  - [ ] Mari  - [ ] Heiki
- [ ] **1. Fix the documents.** Helena updates the spec and Mari the user story. Then both read each other's version to check that they describe the same thing.
- [ ] **2. Agree on the table design.** All three together.
  - Table 1: books (one row per book title)
  - Table 2: copies (one row per physical copy, with its current lending info)
- [ ] **3. Create the tables.** Mari makes the books table and Heiki the copies table. The books table must exist first, because copies point to it.
  - *Check:* the backend starts without errors, and the Animals page still works.
- [ ] **4. Build the APIs.** Helena.
  - *Check:* try each API in Swagger UI (http://localhost:18440/swagger-ui.html) and confirm the data appears in the database.
- [ ] **5. Build the 2 forms.** Mari makes the register form and Heiki the lending form.
  - *Check:* wrong input is refused with an error (e.g. letters in page count, a 10-digit personal code); correct input is saved and shows in the list.
- [ ] **6. Test everything together on localhost.** On the computer you will present from, before 27.11.

### Who does what

| Person | Tasks |
|--------|-------|
| Mari   | User story, books table, register form |
| Heiki  | Copies table, lending form |
| Helena | Spec, APIs, automated tests, final localhost test |

### Comments

- **Step 1:** rename the user story to `BOOKS-US-001.md` so it matches the spec. When all three agree, change the state of both from `Proposed` to `Confirmed`. No coding before that (teacher's rule).
- **Step 2:** the tables are `books.book` and `books.copy`. The name of the second table is still open (`copy` or `item`). Genres are a fixed list inside the books table, not a separate table.
- **Step 3:** table files go in `backend/src/main/resources/books/db/changelog/books/`. Run `.\scripts\check-changesets.ps1` before each pull request. Never edit a merged SQL file; add a new numbered file


- **Deadlines:** defence 27.11.2026, all deliverables 11.12.2026.
